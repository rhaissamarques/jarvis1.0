Welcome

Here are some notes you need to make the program run as smoothly as possible.
1 - I suggest you create a virtual environment
  * Do all the installations of the requirements.txt file
2 - Create an account at https://openweathermap.org (Don't worry, it's free.)
  * Click on your username and then My API Keys
  * Copy the API Key
3 - Create a file in the root of the project called key.py
  * API_KEY = the APY Key that you copied
  * city = the city you want to know the weather
That's all for now. Improvements will come with time.
I hope you enjoy.
